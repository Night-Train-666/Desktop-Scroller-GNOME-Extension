Desktop Scroller Gnome 3 Extension
----------------------------------

This extension allows you to switch between workspaces by scolling your mouse
wheel on the left or right edge of your screen and also when the mouse is over
your desktop background.

Extension is based on the previous work by
  * Marcos Diaz <diazmencia@gmail.com>
  * Arnaud Bonatti <arnaud.bonatti@gmail.com>
  * Bruno Orlandi <brorlandi@gmail.com>

Installing
----------

Copy folder contents into:

  $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/desktop-scroller@brorlandi/

and restart gnome-shell. Don't forget to enable it.

Schemas
-------

When you change the schema for the preferences you have to compile it again.

Compile with:
  $ glib-compile-schemas --strict schemas/


Translations
------------

Extract the translateable strings into new-language.pot:

  $ xgettext -k_ -kN_ -o po/new-language.pot extension.js prefs.js

Create a new translation for e.g. italian:

  $ LANG=it_IT msginit -i po/italian.pot

Or edit the file new-language.pot and edit strings in your language
then save him in (e.g.) italian.pot

Copy italian.pot in it.po

Move the resulting file (it.po) into the po/ folder.

Or update a translation with new strings:

  $ msgmerge -U po/it.po po/italian.pot

Finally create a machine readable file:
(first create the folder with your language code and inside create the folder LC_MESSAGES)
e.g.
  $ cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/desktop-scroller@brorlandi/locale
  $ mkdir it/LC_MESSAGES

  $ msgfmt po/it.po -o locale/it/LC_MESSAGES/desktop-scroller.mo
